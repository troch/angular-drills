angular-drills
==============

Set-up
------
You need to serve `index.hml` so it can be accessed by your browser. You can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

    $ npm install -g http-server

Then, run `http-server` and navigate to `localhost:8080`.

Performing the drills
---------------------
Clone or for the repository.
Checkout the tag you want to work on. Tags are listed below (in each part). All tags are named "x.y" with x the part number and y the drill number.

Part 1 - Working in the view
----------------------------
The aim of "Angular drills part 1" is to focus on the view by using native angularJS directives, to play with UI states and to resist the temptation to use controllers or directives.

During part one, all drills have to be performed __without the use of any controller or custom directive__.

List of drills (with tags):
- 1.1: Filtered ng-repeat
- 1.2: Filtered ng-repeat (2)
- 1.3: Nested ng-repeat with filters
- 1.4: Filtering objects by field
- 1.5: Counting filtering results
- 1.6: Adding controls and bootstrap css
- 1.7: First visualisation step
- 1.8: Improving visualisation
